    "- CDC National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES, 1999-2000): https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=1999\n",
    "- CDC Linked Mortality File (LMF, 1999-2000): https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-linkage/mortality-public.htm\n",

    "NHANES is a rich panel dataset on health and behavior, collected bi-yearly from around 1999 to now. We will focus on the 1999 wave, because that has the largest follow-up window, providing us with the richest mortality data. The mortality data is provided by the CDC Linked Mortality File. \n",

    "First, go to the NHANES and LMF web sites and familiarize yourself with the data sources. Download codebooks. Think about what resources are available. The CDC Linked Mortality File is somewhat of a pain to work with, so I have pre-cleaned it for you. It is available at httts://github.com/ds4e/undergraduate_ml_assignments in the data folder, as `lmf_parsed.cav`. From the CDC LMF web page, get the SAS program to load the data; it is the real codebook.\n",

    "1. Age (RIDAGEYR), because mortality risk and remaining life expectancy rise steeply with age.\n",

    "2. Alcohol use (ALQ variables), given its established relationship with liver disease, injury, and all cause mortality.\n",
    "3. Physical activity indicators, where available, as low activity is strongly associated with higher mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health status and clinical variables (exam and lab files)\n",
    "1. Body mass index and other anthropometrics (e.g., BMXBMI, waist circumference), because obesity and central adiposity predict diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and death.\n",
    "2. Self rated health (e.g., general health question) as a global, subjective predictor that consistently correlates with all cause mortality.\n",
    "3. Selected chronic condition indicators (e.g., self reported diabetes, hypertension) where available, because existing chronic disease burden is directly related to near‑term mortality risk.\n",

    "The complex survey design and weights are not fully incorporated in standard kNN, so our models are predictive for this sample, not strictly nationally representative.\n",
    "Mortality outcomes involve probabilistic linkage and some data perturbation, which introduce outcome error and cap achievable performance.\n",
    "PERMTH_INT is right censored follow up time, but we treat it as a fully observed regression target instead of using survival methods, which can bias life expectancy predictions.\n",
    "Many risk factors are measured once and with error, and we only use a subset of available variables, so important predictors may be omitted, and models trained on 1999 to 2000 data may not generalize to today’s population.\n",
